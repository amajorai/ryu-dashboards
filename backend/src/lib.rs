//! Home dashboards: a customizable, constantly-updating page of widgets.
//!
//! A **dashboard** is a named grid of **widgets**. Each widget has a fixed *kind*
//! (the visual: a stat, a chart, a table, a map, …), a *source* (where its live
//! data comes from: a curated Core endpoint, a monitor, a workflow run, a Composio
//! action, an arbitrary HTTP endpoint, or an agent that re-runs on an interval),
//! a *layout* (x/y/w/h on the grid), and a *refresh interval*. The desktop is a
//! thin renderer that draws widgets from a curated catalog using standard shadcn
//! components only — so every dashboard looks consistent. The AI builder (the
//! left-pane chat, mirroring the workflow/agent builders) authors and arranges
//! dashboards through the `dashboard_builder` MCP tools (a Core-side runnable
//! that consumes this crate's types).
//!
//! This crate is the extracted **Home dashboards** capability. It owns the store,
//! the engine, the widget-source resolver, the refresh loop, the device-image
//! renderer, and the `/api/dashboards/*` HTTP surface. The three cross-cutting
//! calls the source resolver needs — the Gateway URL/token (Composio widgets),
//! the agent runner (agent widgets), and the SSRF-guarded external fetch (HTTP
//! widgets) — are inverted through the [`DashboardsHost`] trait so this crate has
//! ZERO dependency on `apps/core`.
//!
//! This is the `ryu_quests` pattern applied to a live data surface: a SQLite
//! store holds dashboards + widgets, a [`refresh`] tick loop resolves each due
//! widget's source and caches the value, and every fresh value is broadcast over
//! SSE to the desktop. The "constrained catalog" idea (json-render.dev) is
//! realized here as the fixed [`WidgetKind`]/[`WidgetSource`] enums plus the
//! builder tool's JSON schema — that is what guarantees UI consistency, not
//! free-form generated markup.
//!
//! Placement (Core vs Gateway): a dashboard decides *what data is pulled and how
//! often* (orchestration) ⇒ Core. The model/tool calls a widget's source makes at
//! refresh time still route through the Gateway (the agent runner, the Composio
//! execute path) which governs *what is allowed* — nothing here is hardcoded.
